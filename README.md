# rps-odin
This is my first javascript project created for the Odin Project curriculum.
I am using this project to practice what I have learned about javascript so far.
That includes:
- Variables and operators (let, const, logical operators, arithmetic operators et al.)
- Data Types, particularly String and its functions
- Conditionals (if, else, if-else, switch)
- Functions (scope, arrow functions, anonymous functions)

As well as basic debugging through DevTools.

The goal of this project is to create a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game that can be played through the web browser`s console.

## Update (March 24th 2025)
As suggested by the Odin lesson guidelines, I have altered the code and added new features.

These include interactive buttons, score display, and some very basic UI.

This update aims to display my newly-acquired abilities with DOM Manipulation, Git Branching, and Javascript interactivity.
