# rps-odin
This is my first javascript project created for the Odin Project curriculum.
I am using this project to practice what I have learned about javascript so far.
That includes:
- Variables and operators (let, const, logical operators, arithmetic operators et al.)
- Data Types, particularly String and its functions
- Conditionals (if, else, if-else, switch)
- Functions (scope, arrow functions, anonymous functions)
As well as basic debugging through DevTools.

The goal of this project is to create a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game that can be played through the web browser`s console.
